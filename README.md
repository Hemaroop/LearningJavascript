# LearningJavascript
My experiments with building client-side applications using JavaScript. Check out the simple 2 player Tic-tac-toe. Would love some assistance in building a backend for enabling computer vs player games.

# ContourArea
You can draw tha panel of a car and the damage on the panel. This client side application will automatically calculate the damage area as a percentage of panel area. No libraries additional libraries needed.
