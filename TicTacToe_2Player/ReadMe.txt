A very basic 2 player 3x3 Tic-tac-toe web app

Player 1: X
Player 2: O

If any player gets 3 entries in a straight line first, that player wins.
E.g. In the following case Player 1 wins. There are 3 Xs along the minor diagonal.

	X |   | X
	O | X | O
	X |   | O

A draw is called a cat's game.

Further Work:
1. Build a backend logic for Computer vs Human games.
2. Connect the backend system with this client side application.
